# Parking Spots Detector

### Contents:
* test_images : Two sample images to train the code on.
* train_data : Training data for CNN model.
* Identify_Parking_Spots.ipynb : Notebook that uses OpenCV to detect each parking spot and runs the trained model to identify empty spots. test_images folder conatin 2 imges which we will use to predict the parking spot on the imges.
* CNN_Model_For_Occupancy.ipynb : Notebook that uses transfer learning to train a CNN model. It will create a file name car1.h5 which is out and Identify_Parking_Spots.ipynb will that file and will predict the parking spot on the image.
